Hi Jessica,

Congratulations! **CodePath** is pleased to announce that you have been selected to take part in ***CodePath's iOS (Swift) for Designers*** course at the University of Arizona.  Our executive team was impressed with your dedication to achieving your career goals in this field.  Your motivation and the quality and outstanding pre-work submission shined through in your application – both of those qualities will serve you well on your educational and career journeys.  For those reasons and more, you are the CodePath Fall 2017 lucky student!

This course features twelve weeks of intense, project-focused iOS training inspired by our professional bootcamps and facilitated by CodePath-trained Teaching Assistants which will start on **September 27th**. Classes meet on campus twice a week for two-hour lab and coding sessions. During the first half of the course, students build their skills through labs and projects using the APIs of popular apps like Tumblr, Yelp and Twitter. Students then apply what they’ve learned in the second half of the course, working together in small teams to build a completely original app from the ground up. The culmination of the course is a Demo Day event at which students present their finished products to an audience of peers, faculty and industry professionals.

We have high expectations of all students participating in this course and will hold everyone accountable to the strict attendance and assignment submission policies. We only allow 3 absences with prior notice per semester and unexcused absences may result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/ios_university/course_overview#heading-course-policies). 

My compliments again on your scholastic achievements and good luck with your continued studies at the University of Arizona!  Please feel free to respond back if you have any questions regarding this course.

P. S. Make sure to join our [CodePath University Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/codepathuniversity/?ref=br_rs&qsefr=1) if you haven't already.
